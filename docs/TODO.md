## TODO List

- [x] Integrated with slack bot
  - [x] Bot replies messages in the same thread
- [x] Support web page reading with chatGPT
  - [x] Consider to use cloudflare worker to scrape the html content
    - [x] Self-hosting [Web Scraper](https://github.com/adamschwartz/web.scraper.workers.dev)
    - [x] Restrict to access the web scraper, only allow the API server to access it by [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/)
  - [x] Consider to use a headless browser to scrape the web page content like twitter thread
    - ~~https://www.browserless.io/~~
    - https://phantomjscloud.com/
    - https://scrapfly.io/
  - [ ] Consider to use OCR to scrape the web page content (Web crawler to get the screenshot, then OCR to get the text)
    - ~~[Azure OCR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr)~~
    - [Google Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision)
    - may use GPT4
- [x] Support RSS reading with chatGPT
  - RSS is a bunch of links, so it is equivalent to reading a web page to get the content.
- [x] ~~Support newsletter reading with chatGPT~~
  - Most newsletters are public and can be accessed online, so we can just give the url to the slack bot.
- Prompt fine-tue
  - [x] Support for custom `prompt`
  - [x] Show `prompt` templates by slack app slash commands
  - [ ] Auto collect the good `prompt` to `#gpt-prompt` channel by message shortcut
- Cost saving
  - [x] by caching the web page llama index
    - ~~Consider to use [sqlite-vss](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss) to store and search the text embeddings~~
    - ~~Use [chromadb](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) to store and search the text embeddings~~
    - Use the llama index file to restore the index
  - [x] Consider to use [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) or [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) to generate [embeddings](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss/blob/main/examples/headlines/build/add_embeddings.py) (vectors)
    - Not good as the embeddings of OpenAI, rollback to use the OpenAI embeddings, and if enable to use the custom embeddings, the minimum of server's memory is 2GB which still increase the cost.
  - [ ] Consider to fine-tue the chunk size of index node and prompt to save the cost
    - If the chunk size is too big, it will cause the index node to be too large and the cost will be high.
- [x] Bot can read historical messages from the same thread, thus providing context to chatGPT
  - [x] [Changing the number of output tokens](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/issues/778#issuecomment-1478303173)
- Index fine-tune
  - [x] Use the [GPTListIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/issues/753#issuecomment-1472387421) to summarize multiple URLs
  - [ ] Use the `GPTTreeIndex` with `summarize` mode to summarize a single web page
    - Use [response_mode](https://gist.github.com/ninehills/ecf7107574c83016e8b68965bf9a51c4) to change the summary mode
- Bot regularly send hot ~~summarizes(expensive cost)~~ news in the slack channel (`#daily-news`)
  - [x] Use chatGPT to summarize the hot news
  - ~~Refer to [this](https://github.com/SkywalkerDarren/chatWeb/blob/c2ad05a97aecbe1bc0c846476ea003640f2a0f2e/main.py#L144-L175) approach~~
